# Pirate-Game
Homework assignment for Object Oriented Software Development. The challenge was to create a simple gui with a player ship and various enemy entities. The pirate ships had to track and attempt to catch the player, whirlpools had to grab and drag other entities, and the player needed to be able to win by securing a treasure and getting to safety.  We were required to utilize multiple design philosophies in this project.
